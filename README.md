## How to build

For the detailed information about building and developing Venus, please visit the [developer guide](). This page only
gives very basic information.

You require the following to build Venus:

* Latest stable [OpenJDK 21](https://adoptium.net/)
* Latest stable [Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/)

Note that this is build-time requirement. JDK-21 is enough to run your Venus-based application.

## Branches to look

Development of all versions takes place in each branch whose name is identical to <majorVersion>.<minorVersion>. For
example, the development of master resides in the branch 'master' respectively.
